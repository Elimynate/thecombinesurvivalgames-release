## Overview
In this alternate timeline the Combine Forces crushed the Resistance during the events that took place in the Half-Life 2 series.

To solidify their control over the remaining human population, the Advisors established the Combine Survival Games after their decisive victory against the Resistance. Humans with approved Anticitizen status are sent to an arena weekly nearest to their city in groups of twenty-four and are forced to fight against one another.

The main event sees twenty-four citizens with approved Anticitizen status survive in an arena for as long as possible. The arena is dotted with loot containers that participants can break open in the hopes of getting something they need. The event ends when there is only one Anticitizen left alive.
